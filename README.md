CURRENCY JS
-----------

Auto format currency input field with commas and decimals if needed. Text is automatically formated with commas and cursor is placed back where user left off after formatting vs cursor moving to the end of the input. Validation is on KeyUp and a final validation is done on blur.

To use just add the following to an input field:

        <script src="global/res/currency.js"></script>
        <input data-type="currency" type="text">
